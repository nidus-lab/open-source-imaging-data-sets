Cactus dataset,https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jgt7ghdmg5/1,Cactus,Images,Dataset,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,Cactus health/disease detection,"The global climate is currently experiencing rapid changes that have significant impacts on various regions. Consequently, there is a growing inclination towards cultivating non-traditional crops, such as the prickly pear. People are now exploring the diverse health and aesthetic benefits of the prickly pear, beyond its conventional applications in livestock feed and farmland protection. Given this mounting interest, it is imperative to develop enhanced methods for the early detection and treatment of cactus diseases. In light of the limited availability of cactus databases, we have undertaken the task of compiling a comprehensive collection of images portraying both healthy cacti and those infected with the cochineal insect. The intended purpose of this collection is to facilitate advancements in the fields of deep learning and computer vision."
