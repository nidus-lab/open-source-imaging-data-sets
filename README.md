# What is it?

A list of open source ultrasound imaging datasets, maintained by the [NIDUS Lab](https://www.nidusai.ca/) and the [RadOSS](https://radoss.org/).

## How it works

The NIDUS Lab maintain a spreadsheet of open source ultrasound datasets with a number of attributes. When this spreadsheet is updated, a manual export to csv is required, with the resulting csv stored in [`/public/data/snapshot-dataset.csv`](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-imaging-data-sets/blob/main/public/data/snapshot-dataset.csv).

The csv file is pulled through and displayed in [`/pages/index.js`](https://github.com/nidus-lab/open-source-imaging-data-sets/blob/main/public/data/snapshot-dataset.csv).

The columns are parsed on [L41](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-imaging-data-sets/blob/c52345224dc3a70131d95a0d2dde85c13ea3d0e2/pages/index.js#L42) into an object. From here, they are displayed in the table which starts a [L158](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-imaging-data-sets/blob/c52345224dc3a70131d95a0d2dde85c13ea3d0e2/pages/index.js#L158).

If a column in the CSV is changed, added or removed; these are the two locations you'll need to edit in order to get the new data displaying.

## Getting started

You will need:

* node v14
* npm v8.11.0

It is recommended to use a node package manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions.

To run the development server, first install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building

If you want to build and export the project locally, then run the commands below:

```bash
npm run build
```

If the build completes successfully, then you can export the project to static HTML files using the command:

```bash
npm run export
```

**Note:** using the static export feature disables some of the features of Next.js as you can [read here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export). Currently, none of these features are used on this project.

## Deployment

Upon merging into `main`, the project is automatically deployed to Github Pages via a Githook Action found in `.github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yml`.
